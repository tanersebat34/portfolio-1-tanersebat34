                <p>Hello I´m Taner Sebat.</p>
                <p>I spent many years working as a designer in the tattoo industry, where creativity and precision were essential to every design I crafted.
                     This experience taught me not only the importance of aesthetics but also how to create visually compelling designs that resonate with people on a personal level.

                    However, I wanted to extend my creative talents beyond the canvas of the skin and into the digital realm. Driven by my passion for design and a desire to expand my skill set,
                     I began my journey into front-end development. This new field has allowed me to combine my artistic background with the technical tools necessary to create seamless, interactive, 
                     and visually appealing user experiences.
                    
                    Through dedicated learning and hands-on practice, I have developed a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, and Photoshop. My goal is to create websites and applications 
                    that not only function smoothly but also captivate users with intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interfaces.
                    
                    With a unique blend of creativity from my design background and the technical expertise gained as a front-end developer, I am excited to bring my skills to new projects and help 
                    shape the digital experiences of tomorrow.</p>
